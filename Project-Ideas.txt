Springboard Capstone Project Step 1: Initial Project Ideas

This is the very first step in the Capstone Project process for Springboard. Below are some potential ideas to go through
with my Springboard mentor to help decide what web application idea will be used to put together a proposal in Step 2.

Potential Web App ideas:

1. My former job and ongoing hobby is streaming Hearthstone on Twitch. Using the public APIs provided for Hearthstone by 
Blizzard and possibly some data provided by myself, I could create a website of Hearthstone related minigames for fans of
the game to play, or for content creators to use on their stream. I could include a leaderboard for users to see who
performs best at them - although the nature of this would likely mean people could just look up the answers. Games could
include trivia, filling in blanks on cards, naming cards based on art, crosswords etc.

2. An app that keeps track of personalized video game stats. Could have lists of games that are completed, partially
completed - could have a wishlist for desired games, and potentially fetch prices of that game from multiple sources to see
what the best deal is? Could have friends where you can compare what games they have or haven't played. Looks like there is
IGDB which seems to be the video game equivalent to the IMDB. Could also sugguest video games to people based on what the
have enjoyed? Perhaps some sort of tagging system for others to see if they search a game? Rating system of course on which
game they played?

3. Some sort of mystery/escape the room style game that showcases interactivity on the front end. Would have to find ways
to utilize the back end more, with accounts and logins, having the state of your game saved upon returning etc. Would
incorporate some sort of small story with it, and have a few pages for a few rooms. Could incorporate any number of
various external or internal APIs.
